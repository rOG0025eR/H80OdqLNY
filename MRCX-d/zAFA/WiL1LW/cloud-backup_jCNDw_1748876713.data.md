# How to contribute

_Unless you hear different, fork and MR._

## Things to keep in mind:
- keep this in ```bash```
- keep it neat and (fairly) easy to read
- Merge requests will be merged to ```develop``` to fix typos and/or bugs.
- Merge requests with a feature-focus will be merged into a different develop branch for testing. (as much as I can... your environment/OS may be different.)
- Try and keep typo and bugs fixes sepereate from feature MRs.
